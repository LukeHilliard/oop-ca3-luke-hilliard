            Suppose you buy 100 shares of a stock at $12 per share, then another 100 at $10 per share,
            and then sell 150 shares at $15. You have to pay taxes on the gain, but exactly what is the
            gain? In the United States,
            the FIFO rule holds:
            1) You first sell all shares of the first batch for a profit of $300,
            2) then 50 of the shares from the second batch, for a profit of $250,
            3) yielding a total profit of $550.

            Write a program that can make these calculations for arbitrary
            purchases and sales of shares in a single company. The user enters commands
            buy quantity price, and sell quantity (which causes the gain to be displayed), and quit.
            Hint:
            Keep a queue of objects of a class Block that contains the quantity and price of a block of
            shares.
